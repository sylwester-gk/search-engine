The year 2020 has arrived, and its arrival brings a lot of innovations and transformations in the Information and Technology (IT) sector and especially to DevOps technologies. The study conducted by experts at Grand View Research says that the DevOps market is anticipated to be worth 12.85 billion USD by 2025. You may also like: DevOps Adoption Practices The adoption of DevOps practices rose 17% in 2018 as compared to 10% in 2017, according to Statista. It has been seen that top organizations that have included DevOps practices in their Software Development cycle have experienced a 63% improvement in the quality of software deployments. Due to Agile adoption, 63% frequency in the release of new versions of software! Also, higher standards of coding have been observed. The market for DevOps is being driven by the increased adoption of Agile methodologies, cloud technologies, rising digitization, and business automation. Adopting DevOps in the IT culture is a necessity for better team collaborations. Is your business ready to embrace DevOps culture in 2020? Various tools available for DevOps are Docker, Jenkins, GIT, etc. You can always take assistance from Cloud DevOps Consultants or DevOps service providers. If you want to know more about DevOps trends in 2020, then keep reading. The Shift of Winds From CI- Pipelines to DevOps Assembly Lines in 2020. The trends show the interests of the IT industry in CI as the only tool for deployments is slowing down. Continuous Integration (CI) is the process that automates build and runs unit tests on each PUSH of code. CI-Pipelines only work in segments.  In order for all the teams to collaborate better, there is a need for automation of CI along with Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment of the code and binaries to the target environments. That is where DevOps comes into the picture to improve the process of planning, coding, and automation of delivery and deployment. Embedded Security on Top of List Cybersecurity is one of the vital concerns for IT corporations. DevOps is going to be spending a lot of resources on security. The term being used is DevSecOps. The increase in the need for security has made the integration of security in the application development process necessary. By this measure, the vulnerabilities will decrease, and the whole process will be effective, secure, and efficient. Need for Server-Less Architecture There will be a simplification of operations with the server-less architecture used by DevOps teams. Legacy systems are being upgraded to server-less operations with solutions like Google Functions, AWS Lambda, and Microsoftâ€™s Azure Functions. This change is cost-effective and also improves the experience of users. This server-less architecture will be the go-to architecture for developers to increase productivity and will need DevOps automation more than ever. The Future Is Zero-Touch Automation Zero-touch automation is the future of DevOps automation. There will be no need for human intervention when machine learning is utilized to automate the back-up of vast data fully. The companies which have already implemented or adapted DevOps have seen a significant increase in productivity and faster rates of deployment. Understanding the DevOps cycle and administering automation between all the blocks of sequences. Shift to Cloud-Native DevOps There will be an accelerated shift to Cloud-native DevOps since all the enterprises are moving to Cloud-based enterprise products. Cloud adoption ensures flexibility, less downtime, reduces infrastructure expenditures. Gartner predicts that shift to the cloud by 2022 will effect 1.3 Trillion USD of IT industry spending directly or indirectly. Many companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon provide cloud computing and storage facilities and smooth operations. These companies are seeing a massive spike in other enterprises looking for their cloud services for faster changes in production. Containers in Demand Kubernetes, Dockers, are the container technologies that are in demand due to their ability to deploy the applications independent of the platforms or OS. Containerisation has been trending in the IT sector after the launch of these Container technologies. These containers make distributed development a reality, and delivery can be further improved.  These are prominent DevOps automation tools. There is a considerable adoption of containers like Docker and Kubernetes in companies to run their small or large scale apps on the cloud. This will propel these containers further in 2020. Need for Code Will Increase Knowledge of coding is going to be in demand. The automation for DevOps requires scripts, and Developers or Testers will be expected to know the scripting languages to code the automation scripts. Manual Testing will be obsolete in the future, and automation a must. Testers have to step-up and learn different coding languages to stay up-to-date. Artificial Intelligence in Forefront AI technology and data sciences are showing a lot of potential in the DevOps world. The applications which are driven on Artificial Intelligence are the future, and these teams are turning towards DevOps for automating their application cycles. The continuous process will help AI apps to be tested more frequently, and the Algorithms developed at a higher pace with more accuracy.
