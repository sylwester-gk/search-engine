We’re holding the event starting at 9 am PDT on March 19th (the Spring equinox!) - yes! that’s _soon! - so register now, add it to your calendar, and make sure you’re in a comfy chair, have coffee at the ready, and have your thinking caps on. This conference is virtual. We’re throwing this virtual conference because we want our community to be healthy, happy, and safe as the #COVID-19 pandemic rages through local communities worldwide. We’re a global community, and that’s true whether we meet in person or not. For each person who joins the event, we’ll make a donation to the Center for Disaster Philanthropy (COVID-19 Response Fund).
