Hi, Spring fans! We hope you’ll join us for an interactive, 24-hour long, virtual conference called Spring Live. Here’s what you need to know: it’s 24-hours long, end to end, so there’s bound to be content you can watch no matter what part of the world you’re in. It’s free! It’s interactive - so the speakers will be hanging around to answer questions and do Q/A. Some speakers are going to pre-record their talks proper just so they can spend the entire slot for their talk answering questions and interacting directly with you. We’ve invited experts from the wide world of Springdom from VMWare (where the Spring team lives), Okta, Confluent, Google, Microsoft, and IBM, and so many others.
